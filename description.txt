The Light Reveals is an mod that focuses on built-in compabilities for mods I like, yet it works on it's own.

Mods that are compatible:
- Secrets of the Shadows (I love that mod. It's the original mod I planned compatibility for.)

Three new classes that are usually paired with melee, ranged, magic and summon weapons.
- HOLY weapons, which can spread the hallow, and benefit from it's existence
- UNHOLY weapons, which can spread the corruption / crimson, and benefit from it's existence.
- SACRIFICAL weapons, which use your stats to deal damage.

Some accessories have SYNERGIES when using them both.

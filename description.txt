The Light Reveals is an mod that adds all sorts of stuff I think of.

A new class, Healer! (well what do you consider "new"... thorium already did it but I do not care)

Mods that are compatible:
- Secrets of the Shadows (Upcoming)
Mods that are NOT compatible: (If you try to play with them your computer will EXPLODE!!! (maybe))
- Thorium (Both classes have healers. Will have to add compats later)
Some accessories have SYNERGIES when using them both.

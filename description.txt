The Light Reveals is an mod that adds all sorts of stuff I think of, such as...

Three new subclasses, Style, Cookie and Support.

Style focuses on gaining or losing STYLE via their actions. STYLE weapons and accessories benefit from a good style, and suffer from a bad style.

Cookie is not a clicker class... It's the Cookie Clicker class! Automate making cookies, or make them manually. Use the cookies to buff the cookie weapons!

Support is weaker on their own, but focuses on buffing, healing and restoring mana to allies!

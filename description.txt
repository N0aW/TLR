The Light Reveals is an mod that adds all sorts of stuff I think of, such as...

A new mechanic and class, Style!

Gain Style by doing stylish things, such as killing bosses, using specific accessories, etc.

Style can be used by STYLE weapons and accessories! These benefit from having a positive style count, and suffer from having a negative one!

Style can be lost by doing UNSTYLISH things such as dying and taking damage!

Mods that are compatible:
- Secrets of the Shadows

Code will be hidden from extraction due to it using code from SOTS.

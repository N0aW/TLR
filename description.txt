The Light Reveals is an mod that focuses on built-in compabilities for mods I like, yet it works on it's own.

Adds two new damage classes, HOLY and UNHOLY. These are usually in tandem with other damage classes.

The HOLY class is mostly locked in hardmode, since it's based off the hallow. (Expection: Enchanted Sword!)
The UNHOLY class is avaivable during the whole game, since it's based off the corruption and crimson.

The HOLY and UNHOLY class can be paired with the VOID class from Secrets of the Shadows.

Mods that are compatible:
- Secrets of the Shadows (I love that mod. It's the original mod I planned compatibility for.)

# The Light Reveals (TLR)
## Version: `v0.10`
The Light Reveals adds basically all sorts of stuff I think of.

The mod serves to add more combinations for existing accessories (etc. Yoyo Bag), new concepts and QoL features!

This is a beta version with unfinished sprites, lacking content etc.

Inspiration taken from Hotline Miami, Enter the Gungeon, ULTRAKILL & Brawl Stars.

I am currently on break. Feel free to create issues and PRs.

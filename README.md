# The Light Reveals (TLR)
The Light Reveals adds basically all sorts of stuff I think of.

Inspiration taken from Hotline Miami, Enter the Gungeon, ULTRAKILL & Brawl Stars.

Adds actually a ton of content from brawl stars. A new class, new gadgets, new star powers, hypercharges etc...

I do not own any of the content from the above games, and if an item is a straight reference, i will mark it.

#### Will this work in multiplayer?
I have no idea since none of my friends play Terraria ðŸ˜”
Due to this most support weapons are made to give yourself heals, mana and buffs etc

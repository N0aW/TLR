# The Light Reveals (TLR)
## Version: `v0.8.2`
The Light Reveals adds basically all sorts of stuff I think of.

Inspiration taken from Hotline Miami, Enter the Gungeon, ULTRAKILL & Brawl Stars.

## Two New Subclasses!
### The Sadist
- "Do you enjoy hurting others?"
- This subclass allows you to HURT town NPCs.
- This subclass benefits from hurting your allies/friends.
### The Masochist
- "Bros opps are himself ðŸ’€"
- This subclass offers high damage output.
- This subclass hurts yourself as ammo.
#### Will this work in multiplayer?
I have no idea since none of my friends play Terraria ðŸ˜”
### Add-Ons:
- The Light Reveals + (SOTS compats)
### Credits/Special Thanks:
- Secrets of the Shadows
    - The main inspiration for this mod.

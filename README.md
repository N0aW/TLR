# The Light Reveals (TLR)
## Version: `v0.11-beta.4`
The Light Reveals adds basically all sorts of stuff I think of.

The mod serves to add more combinations for existing accessories (etc. Yoyo Bag), new concepts and QoL features!

This is a beta version with unfinished sprites, lacking content etc.

Vanilla polishing is also a part with things like tool reworks, pearlwood reworks and NPC weapon reworks.

Inspiration taken from Secrets of the Shadows.

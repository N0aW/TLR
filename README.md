# The Light Reveals (TLR)
The Light Reveals adds basically all sorts of stuff I think of.

Four new subclasses, Style, Cookie, Support and Sacrifical!

Style focuses on gaining or losing STYLE via their actions. STYLE weapons and accessories benefit from a good style, and suffer from a bad style.

Cookie is not a clicker class... It's the Cookie Clicker class! Automate making cookies, or make them manually. Use the cookies to buff the cookie weapons!

Support is weaker on their own, but focuses on buffing, healing and restoring mana to allies!

Sacrifical uses their own Health for greater damage!

A new stat, Vampirism!
Basically, vampirism allows you to recover life every time you hit an enemy.
Vampirism is DIFFERENT from Lifesteal because it has no cooldown but has greatly decreased healing.
#### Will this work in multiplayer?
I have no idea since none of my friends play Terraria ðŸ˜”
